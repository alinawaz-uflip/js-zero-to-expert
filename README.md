# Guess My Number Game

This application generates a random number between 1 and 20 for the user to guess. It will let the user know if the guess is too high or low, and implements a score and highscore functionality.

## Coding Challenge #1

Implement a game rest functionality, so that the player can make a new guess!
Your tasks:

1. Select the element with the 'again' class and attach a click event handler
2. In the handler function, restore initial values of the 'score' and
   'secretNumber' variables
3. Restore the initial conditions of the message, number, score and guess input
   fields
4. Also restore the original background color (#222) and number width (15rem)
